I build ML/Agentic apps with a background with Traefik, k8s, Flink, and WanDB. I'm currently pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science (ML track) at Georgia Tech.

My recent work includes an image-to-3d-print app using text-gen and diffusion models, an adapted transformer model for stock trading, and a LLM-based app for medial diagnosis coding. I also have three years of leadership experience in enterprise operations and 8 years in the military as a Signal soldier (sysadmin Army work.)

Outside of work, I’m passionate about mentoring and managing the ever-expanding homelab.
