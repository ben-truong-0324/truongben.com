I am a ML engineer with DevOps experience and cross-disciplinary background in NLP, public-sector technology, and operational analytics. I'm currently pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science (ML track) at Georgia Tech, while also leading ML analytics products and GenAI application pipelines in civic tech and nonprofit spaces.

My recent work includes a ML-driven dashboard for financial insights on K8s, a RL model for stock trading, and a scalable LLM evaluation pipelines for hospital coding. I bring over three years of leadership experience in enterprise operations and 8 years in military Signal operations. My focus is on reproducibility and documentation for joint development between business and technical teams.

Outside of work, I’m passionate about open-source tools, community mentoring, and ML on consumer hardware.
